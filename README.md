## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind Css
- PostCss (for tailwind config only)
- Vitejs
- esLint
- Prettier
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I learned a few new keywords in javascript, but nothing really life-changing. But building this project using oop principles was actually kinda cool, I learned about static methods, the `this` keyword, the OO mindset... very cool experience (but i still prefer the functional paradigm :D). When I find the opportunity to use OO principles again, i'm definitly gonna use them.
